Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

    •	The purpose of DriverPass is to build a platform that allows customers with the proper training to pass their written and on the road exams. DriverPass wants to build a system that will allow their customers to book and modify reservations for driving lessons, as well as provide different driving packages based on the customer’s needs. 
    •	DriverPass wants their system to be able to access data from anywhere, online & offline, this will allow the owner to download reports from any location. The problem they are looking to fix is building a system that allows better driver training. They noticed that a lot of people fail their driving test, so starting this company will allow them to stay within the DMV requirements while allowing customers the proper training to pass the written and on the road exam. Some components that will be needed for this system are making sure the system runs off web and over the cloud. 

What did you do particularly well?

    •I believe my time management and organizational skills helped me in making sure this course was a success.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    •If I could revise one part of my work on these documents, I would revise my UML chart in my System design document. I did well in explaining all the moving parts of the            overall system, but I think I could have done better when labeling classes and functions.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    •To make sure I interpreted all the user's needs I pulled them directly from the document that was given to us. I found that writing down all user needs and checking them off      as I accomplished them was the easiest way to make sure the customer was satisfied when turning in the final project. It's so important to consider their needs because the        customer is who will be using the system, so its important to make sure they are satisfied.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    • An approach I will use in the future to analyze and design a system will be using use case diagrams. As a visual learner I prefer this method because it allows me to see all       the moving parts of the system before I begin designing.
